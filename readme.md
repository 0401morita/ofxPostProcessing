# ofxPostProcessing

This openFrameworks addon gives you an easy way of putting together a chain of GLSL shaders.

## Features

At the moment, it comes with the following effects (both ported from various other sources as well as some original ones) that I'll gradually add to over time:

* Bloom
* Convolution
* Depth of field (with bokeh)
* Depth of field alternative (more features but heavier)
* Frei-ChenÂ Edge Detector
* FXAA anti-aliasing
* Kaleidoscope
* Noise warp
* Pixelate

## Usage

In your OF app declare an instance of **ofxPostProcessing**...

```cpp
ofxPostProcessing post;
```

In your **setup()** function initialise the post-processing class and then add some effects...

```cpp
post.init(ofGetWidth(), ofGetHeight());
post.createPass<FxaaPass>();
post.createPass<BloomPass>();
```

Call **post.begin()** and **post.end()** around the the scene that you want to render...

```cpp
post.begin();
<RENDERING CODE>
post.end();
```

If you are using an **ofCamera** pass this to post.begin and it takes care of the rest for you...

```cpp
post.begin(cam);
<RENDERING CODE>
post.end();
```

## TODO
* More FX
* OpenGL ES, it's based around power of two textures so it should be fairly quick to get working.
